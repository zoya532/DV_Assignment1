# README: Data Visualization A1

## Overview
This performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on student attendance records. It includes data loading, preprocessing, visualization, and insights generation.

## Features
- **Data Ingestion**: Reads attendance data from Excel files.
- **Data Cleaning**: Skips unnecessary header rows, selects relevant columns, and formats roll numbers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides statistical summaries and visualizations.
- **Data Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate graphs.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
```

## Instructions
1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zoya532/DV_Assignment1
   cd DataVisualization_A1
   ```
2. **Open the Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook DataVisualization_A1.ipynb
   ```
3. **Ensure Dataset Availability**
   Place the required Excel files in the designated folder.
   
5. **Run the Notebook**
   Execute all cells sequentially to generate results.

## Expected Output
- Cleaned and structured dataset
- Summary statistics of attendance records
